# Note

The belt dampener doesn't work very well. The belt starts to increase tension over time and the spool motion is not smooth.

But there is an easy fix for now:

1. Fully remove the belt
2. Add one washer+lockwasher+washer to each side of the screws holding the spool (left/right)
3. Adjust the tension using those screws

Also mount the spool flipped by 180Â° and bring the spool more forward by skipping the back mounting screw row and only use the two front screws to mount it.
