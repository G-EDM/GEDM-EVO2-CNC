Print tips:

Spool holder main can be printed with 25% infill and 5 walls.
It is a big part and it is highly recommended to add some adhesive to the build plate. I use 
strong hairspray. Lots of it.

All other PLA+ parts are printed with 100 infill.


The TPU ring is printed with 1 wall and 20% infill to keep it soft.

Build tips: 

Use a stormlighter to heat screws and screw them in hot where needed to create the threading. Same process sued for hexnuts too. 

It is also recommended to carefully use a stormlighter on the big part and re-melt the outer layers at critical position. Needs to be done carefully and fast to not burn the plastic or create burned spots. This increases the average strength heavily.


If the adapter is hard to put into the spool just put an M6 screw into a drill, screw the adapter on it and sand it down until it fits.
