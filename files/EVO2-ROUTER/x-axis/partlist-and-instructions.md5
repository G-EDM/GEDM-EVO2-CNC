1x 500mm 1605 SFU ballscrew with SF12 / SK12 bearing blocks and a DSGH16H nut housing
2x 500mm HGR20 linear rail
2x HGH20CA linear block

Note: Most sets of linear rails ship with 2 blocks per rail. We don't need to blocks per rail and it is possible to just take one 1000mm rail with two block and cut it into two 500mm rails.

1x Aluminum plate 600mm x 85mm x 20mm (best is to have grinded surface and a precision cut; The cut needs to be very very parallel!)


1x M3 to M6 flat washers and lock washers (a set or jsut a bunsh of them for eevery size)


Screws:

4x M6x30mm (To mount the spoolholed onto the slide)
4x M5x12
8x M5x20
4x M3x (to mount the Nema17)
1x M8x (to mount the belt tensioning bearings)
2x M3x12 (to tighten the big pulley)
2x M3 setscrew (to tighten the small pulley)
3x M6x (to mount the motor bracket onto the portal plate)
1x M5x (to mount the motor bracket onto the portal plate)

2x M6x (for the BF12) // If you don't have good tools and use a hand drill I recommend to mount those bearings with M5 instead of M6. Using M5 gives some more room for misalignment while drilling)
4x M6x (for the BK12) // If you don't have good tools and use a hand drill I recommend to mount those bearings with M5 instead of M6. Using M5 gives some more room for misalignment while drilling)

4x M5x (for the DSGH16H)

Hex Nuts:

A bunsh of M6 hex nuts (just a few, maybe 10)
A bunsh of M3 hex nuts (just a few for the pulleys needed. Maybe 4)


2x Ball bearings 608ZZ 8mmx22mx7mm (height can be more than 7mm too. Even with two bearings it is a tight fit for the belt on the edge.)



10mm GT2 belt (closed; length not determined yet)


Print tips:

The big XZ slide needs to be printed laying on the left side. Normal supports touching buildplate only and 30Â° support overhang angle.
A Brim is also needed. I used a 15mm Brim.
Another important thing is to spray the printbed with some kind of adhesive. Strong hairspray works for Ender3v2 printbeds. A lot of it.

The part is heavy duty and consumes almost an entire spool. Travelspeed should be reduced. My ender is modified with MGN12 lienar rails and used 110mm/min for travels. 
Layerheight can be 0.3mm. My print took <50 hours.



Build tips:

After the part is finished it is recommened to increase the average strenght with the help of remelting.
At least the holes need to be remeleted. Bolting M6 screw tightly can easily split the layer apart. To do so just use a small blowtorch and heat up the inner holes.

I remelted the full outer part but this will shrink the part heavily and needs to be done carefully.

Mount the part first to prevent the shrinking from respotioning the holes etc too much. Then blowtorch along the part fast and until the surface gets glossy.
Don't do this with the full part at once. Surface after surface and in between letting it cool down.

To give it a nice matte finish the part can then get a little sanding.

Some holes may need to be drilled to size after printing and if something does not fit well it is possible to use a soldering iron to change the hole positions.

If there is too much resistance in the ballscrew it is also possible to soften the back and/or top of the slide to release the stress and force it into a perfect fit.
