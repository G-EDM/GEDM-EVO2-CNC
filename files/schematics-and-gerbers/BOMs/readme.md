# Warning:

No warranties. The BOMs may contain errors or miss parts. I have done them really quick without deeper review.


Some parts of the BOM are using the discount price if 10 pieces are bought. Nobody buys 1 0805 SMD resistor etc.

Sensorboard: 57,17.- (Euros)
Motionboard: 13,80.-
Pulseboard: 41,25.-

112.25.- for the PCB components without taxes. 
134.65 with tax


PCBway has a minimum order of 5 PCBs per board. A full set ordered from PCBway would contain:
     5 Motionboards
     5 Sensorboards
     5 Pulseboards

Cost with tax and shipment for the 15 PCBs:
     175.77.- (Euros)

Per Set (One of each boards):
     35.154.-
     
Total for One populated Set of boards:
    169.80.-

Other parts needed: JST male connectors, wires etc are not calculated yet. 
ESP32 and TMC drivers are not included in the motionboard BOM




There are other parts needed like:

M3 Hex spacer M3*26mm
