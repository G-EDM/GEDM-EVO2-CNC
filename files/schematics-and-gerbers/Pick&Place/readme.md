# WARNING!!!

This is currently a work in progress to provide files for PCBA (Assembly) services.

It is not finished yet and needs validation and testing first.

The BOMs only contain the SMD parts and not the through hole parts.

There are some problems figuring out the correct footprints for the ICs. Every manufacturer names things different and it is a total mess.
In the end there are all kinds of footprints labeled as for example SOP-8 but have massive difference in size.
Then there is SOIC-8 which seems to be the same as "some" SOP-8 etc.

Industry messed this up badly and I have to sort this out first.
