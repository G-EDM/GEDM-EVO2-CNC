The full electronic enclosure contains the control panel with the ESP32 motion controller and a touch screen and the spark generator.

The pulseboard and the sensing unit are two dedicated PCBs stacked on top of eachother.

The sensing unit is not bound to the G-EDM pulseboard and can be used with a custom generator as well.

Currently only the schmeatics of the pulseboard PCB is uploaded here.

Sennsing unit / motionboard and gerber files will follow.

The pulseboard can be used as stand-alone board too but the sensing is not comparable to the new sense circuit that is able to capture raw watercontact and even the tiniest discharges.
