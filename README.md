# This project is still a work in progress and not fully finished yet

The GEDM-EVO2 Router uses heavy duty 3D printed parts, strong HGR20 linear rails, ballscrews and heavy profiles.

The design is build around the multiuse concept. With only a few upgrades/changes it will be able to not only do EDM but also mill wood and smaller aluminum parts.

In order to do those milling jobs it may require a second ballscrew on the left side.
