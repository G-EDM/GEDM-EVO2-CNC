# This project is still a work in progress and not fully finished yet

The GEDM-EVO2 Gantry Router uses heavy duty 3D printed parts, strong HGR20 linear rails, ballscrews and heavy profiles (40x160).

With only a few upgrades/changes it will be able to not only do EDM but also mill wood and smaller aluminum parts.

In order to do those milling jobs it may require a second ballscrew on the left side.

The wire extension used in the images is the one designed by Alex Treseder for the PicoEDM:

Not fully finished. Z axis is still missing and the massive aluminum plate on the front is temporary.
